    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>
        Larping Loons Outpost is run by Ben, a longtime Magic: The Gathering player and collector
        based in rural Minnesota. What started as a passion for Commander and deckbuilding slowly grew into
        a small business focused on transparency, fair offers, and curated products that players actually enjoy.

    <h3>What I Do</h3>
    <p>
        I specialize in buying collections, sorting bulk, and creating curated Commander packs designed to
        spark creativity and help players build new decks without breaking the bank. Every card is checked,
        sorted, and handled with care — no junk, no surprises, no mystery‑box nonsense.

    <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
        Magic is a game built on community. My goal is to treat every seller and buyer with respect, offer
        fair and honest pricing, and create products that feel personal and thoughtfully assembled. Whether
        you're selling a binder, a shoebox, or a full collection, I want the process to feel simple and stress‑free.

    <h3>Where I'm Based</h3>
    <p>
        Larping Loons Outpost operates out of the Brainerd Lakes area in Minnesota. I meet locally when possible,
        and I also work with sellers through shipping if you're outside the area.
